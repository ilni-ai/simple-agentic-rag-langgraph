Software engineering is a systematic approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It encompasses requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance, with a focus on quality and efficiency.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
RAG combines the strengths of information retrieval systems with generative AI models. The retrieved data enhances factual grounding, reducing hallucinations in generated outputs.

Agentic AI
Agentic AI refers to systems capable of planning, executing, and adapting autonomously to achieve complex goals. These systems simulate human-like decision-making and dynamic interactions.

Estimated Population of the Earth

Great Circle
A great circle is the largest circle that can be drawn on a sphere. It divides the sphere into two equal hemispheres and represents the shortest path between two points on the surface.
